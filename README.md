# telematrix

A bridge between Telegram and [Matrix](http://matrix.org/). Currently under development — this project isn't considered to be in a usable state right now.

## Installation
### Dependencies

First, create a virtualenv and activate it:

```bash
virtualenv venv -p $(which python3)
. venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
TODO

## Contributions

Want to help? Awesome! This bridge still needs a lot of work, so any help is welcome.

A great start is reporting bugs — if you find it doesn't work like it's supposed to, do submit an issue on Github. Or, if you're a programmer (which you probably are, considering you are on this website), feel free to try to fix it yourself. Just make sure Pylint approves of your code!
