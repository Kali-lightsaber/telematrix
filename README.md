# telematrix

A bridge between Telegram and [Matrix](http://matrix.org/). Currently under development - this project isn't considered to be in a usable state right now.

## Contributions

Want to help? Awesome! This bridge still needs a lot of work, so any help is welcome.

A great start is reporting bugs - if you find it doesn't work like it's supposed to, do submit an issue on Github. Or, if you're a programmer (which you probably are, considering you are on this website), feel free to try to fix it yourself. Just make sure Pylint approves of your code!
